Given the simplicity of the formula for the egg-drop
numbers, one might suspect that there is a direct counting technique we could use.
Indeed, there is. Consider a specific sequence of at most n drops with k eggs. Each of
the drops has two possible outcomes: either the egg breaks or the egg does not break.
Let 0 represent a drop without a break and 1 a drop with a break. Our sequence of
drops thus yields a binary word of length at most n and having between zero and k Is.
With this representation of drops, each word corresponds to a unique floor. For
example, in the case of 8 drops and 2 eggs, the word 01001 corresponds to floor 11.
In the general case, we make words of length m < n have length n by adding n - m
trailing zeros. Note that we only need do this for words that have exactly k Is, since
the efficiency of our procedure ensures that words with fewer than k broken eggs are
guaranteed to use all n drops. Also note that the trailing zeros are merely placeholders
and do not represent drops.
Thus, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the floors in our building and
the number of binary words of length n with at least one and no more than k Is. The
latter is easily shown to be k=1 sigma[j=1->k](nCj) while the former is (n,k).
